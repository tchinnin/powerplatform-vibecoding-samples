# Power Platform Vibe Coding Instructions & Samples

## Introduction

Power Platform Solutions have always been customisable using pro-code : Dataverse Plugins, Power Apps PCF, Model-Driven client side scripts, etc...
It was not maker friendly as it required pro-code skills.
With Generative AI, these types of customizations are way more accessible to "professional makers".
That's what Vibe coding is : Using GenAI to write pro-code projects.

Vibe coding becoming so efficient, that new features are coming to Power Platform :
- Power Apps Code Apps : Deploying React Application on Power Apps Infrastructure
- Power Pages Single Page Applications (SPA): Deploying Single Pages Applications on Power Pages Infrastructure

These 2 features are, in my opinion, the first step of Power Platform into a new area that will change Power Platform development for ever.
- We use traditional pro-code for UI, with all best practices (source control, tests, CI/CD, etc...)
- We use Entreprise Ready backbone that is Power Platform Infrastructure : Environments, Dataverse, Governance, SÃ©curity, Connectors, Portal Web API, etc...
